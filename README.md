# Listana-Mobile
Listana is an iOS app that keeps track of the movies the user have seen, allowing the user to create different custom lists and add movies to them.
Every user has a Favorite Movies List, and can add/remove movies to/from that list, too.
The user can search in a movie database. The app uses the TMBD API and therefore the TMDB database.
The app was created as an React Native exercise, not with the purpose of publishing it in the AppStore or selling it for money. At least for now.
